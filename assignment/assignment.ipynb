        "**Q1.** Please answer the following questions in your own words.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. How are trees constructed?\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Splits the data recursively using observations to\n",
        "predict outcomes for future cases and possibilities of inputs. Decision nodes are the decision points, edges are the lines connecting each decision nodes as choices are made and terminal nodes are the final outcome\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How do trees handle non-linear relationships between variables? Compare this to linear models.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Decision trees split data based on the possible responses to narrow down the final outcome, such as size-->color-->shape-->result. This hierarchy relationship allows nonlinear relationships to be displayed more effectively. With linear models, the results are formed from the basis that there IS linear relationship, or some sort of line of best fit that can be formed based on the data by expanding polynomial terms and forming interactions, which isn't always the case or doesn't truly display the relationship effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Why is the Gini a good loss function for categorical target variables?\n",
        "* Gini measures the \"purity\" of a node. In other words, the less different answer there are conflicting with the node, the more pure it is and gini will be closer to 0. For example a color node red is perfectly pure if there are no other colors and thus the conclusion will always be red. This si a good loss function for categorical target variables because it measures how accurate the classifications are based on the training data. It also provides insight for the best ways to split the features.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Why do trees tend to overfit, and how can this tendency be constrained?\n",
        "* Trees tend to overfit because the decision nodes are highly dependent on the direct results of the training data. Data may not capture all possible results and as such, if used for other data, the missing possible values will be completely absent in predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. True or false, and explain: Trees only really perform well in situations with lots of categorical variables as features/covariates.\n",
        "* False. Trees are capable of performing well with less categorical variables or even numerical variables as a metric of comparison, like age or income.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why don't most versions of classification/regression tree concept allow for more than two branches after a split?\n",
        "* Binary split is much simpler, low-cost, efficient to create and avoids overfitting much better.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are some heuristic ways you can examine a tree and decide whether it is probably over- or under-fitting?\n",
        "* Checking accuracy with a test set, how many levels a tree has, if there's too many/too few nodes, nodes with small smamples, inability to capture patterns on either set, etc."
