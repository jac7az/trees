        "**Q1.** Please answer the following questions in your own words.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. How are trees constructed?\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Splits the data recursively using observations to\n",
        "predict outcomes for future cases and possibilities of inputs. Decision nodes are the decision points, edges are the lines connecting each decision nodes as choices are made and terminal nodes are the final outcome\n",
        "\n",
        "2. How do trees handle non-linear relationships between variables? Compare this to linear models.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Decision trees split data based on the possible responses to narrow down the final outcome, such as size-->color-->shape-->result. This hierarchy relationship allows nonlinear relationships to be displayed more effectively. With linear models, the results are formed from the basis that there IS linear relationship, or some sort of line of best fit that can be formed based on the data by expanding polynomial terms and forming interactions, which isn't always the case or doesn't truly display the relationship effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Why is the Gini a good loss function for categorical target variables?\n",
        "* Gini measures the \"purity\" of a node. In other words, the less different answer there are conflicting with the node, the more pure it is and gini will be closer to 0. For example a color node red is perfectly pure if there are no other colors and thus the conclusion will always be red. This si a good loss function for categorical target variables because it measures how accurate the classifications are based on the training data. It also provides insight for the best ways to split the features.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Why do trees tend to overfit, and how can this tendency be constrained?\n",
        "* Trees tend to overfit because the decision nodes are highly dependent on the direct results of the training data. Data may not capture all possible results and as such, if used for other data, the missing possible values will be completely absent in predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. True or false, and explain: Trees only really perform well in situations with lots of categorical variables as features/covariates.\n",
        "* False. Trees are capable of performing well with less categorical variables or even numerical variables as a metric of comparison, like age or income.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why don't most versions of classification/regression tree concept allow for more than two branches after a split?\n",
        "* Binary split is much simpler, low-cost, efficient to create and avoids overfitting much better.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are some heuristic ways you can examine a tree and decide whether it is probably over- or under-fitting?\n",
        "* Checking accuracy with a test set, how many levels a tree has, if there's too many/too few nodes, nodes with small smamples, inability to capture patterns on either set, etc."

Companies often have multiple reviews at different dates. We want to predict the bond rating (AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, ..., C, D). Do business fundamentals predict the company's rating?\n",

        "1. Open `./data/creditcard_fraud.csv`. Print the number of observations and variables, and look at the first few rows of data. The variables are already normalized and de-identified, and are just called things like `V8` to protect the privacy of the clients.\n",

This is a serious **class imbalance** problem: The minority class is so small that essentially predicting 0's for all cases will achieve an extremely high accuracy. There are over-sampling techniques to deal with this issue, but we don't have time to cover them in class.\n",

        "4. Imagine that you block every transaction in the test set labelled as fraudulent. How much money is (1) saved that should be saved, (2) lost to fraud anyway, (3) withheld in error from customers? Does implementing this anti-fraud system seem like a good idea, or not? Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Instead of predicting fraud, predict loss: Multiple the `Class` variable times the `Amount` variable, and call it `Loss`. Predict it using a decision tree regressor (making sure to drop Class, Time, and Loss from the features/covariates/predictors). What $R^2$ and RMSE do you get? Make a scatterplot of the predicted values on the test group versus the actual test values. Do you notice any interesting patterns? How could you use this algorithm to decide which transactions to block, and why?\n"
